> Docker:

    - docker container is not  virtual machine, Its an isolation env for running a process, the
        life-cycle is bound to process running inside it.
    
    - docker inspect a docker image: 
        $ docker inspect ubuntu
    
    - docker entering into a container
        $ docker run -it ubuntu

        this will start a process /bin/bash and we are entering in the interactive mode and 
            allocated a tty for it.
        
        

> Shell Scripting:

    - print the default Shell   
        $ echo $SHELL

    - count the number of lines containing the word 'docker' in this file:
        $ grep docker 'shell scripting' | wc -l

    - sort and more:
        $ grep docker 'shell scripting' | sort -n -k 3 | more

        grep searches for word docker in the given file and outputs it to sort command 
            which will sort the input and outputs to more, which paginates the result.

        pipeline starts executing from more and its input is attached to a pipe, and so on..

    - simple shell script:

        #!/bin/sh
        cat $0
        echo "==="
        tac $0

        $0 is special variable defined by the system and contains the name of the currently 
            running program.

        $ tac - consoles the content of the file in the reverse order.
